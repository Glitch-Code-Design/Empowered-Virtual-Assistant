                    Social media is the front house of every business. It’s how you get your name out there.

                <p>
                    Are you utilising it as much as you should? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today we’re going to look at the first of five main social media platforms that businesses should use and how they differ from each other in performance.

                    Many business owners have the thought process of “just put something out there” rather than having a strategic plan thinking of who they want to talk to and the influence that they will have on their readers. This means that without a plan their social media is lacking. Social media is an environment which should be welcoming, fun and informative, without being too formal.

                    First up we’re looking at Facebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facebook has over 2 billion active users. Many business owners use Facebook to engage with new and existing customers. The type of content you create needs to resonate with your customers, or they will just ignore it! When consumers start to ignore your posts, Facebook will stop showing them as much to others, meaning your engagement will fall and this will stop you from getting that all-important brand awareness. In order to stop this from happening have a plan in place.
